# watch-compa

A multi-surface prototyping stack for streaming Apple Watch input into spatial experiences. The repo contains a WebSocket relay, a paired watchOS/iOS controller app, and experimental clients (native ARKit and WebXR) that consume the live stream. The goal is to explore watch-driven pointer/gesture control for head-worn and browser-based XR setups.
